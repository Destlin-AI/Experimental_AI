n{pformat(data)}')
```

Replace `'path/to/your/directory'` with the path to your directory containing YAML files. Run this script, and it will output each loaded YAML file content in a formatted manner.

Firstly, make sure you have PyYAML installed:

```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

Response:
To load and parse YAML files from a directory, you can use the PyYAML library. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running `pip install pyyaml`. Here is a simple script that iterates through a directory and loads each YAML file:

```python
import os
from yaml import load_safe, FullLoader

def load_yaml_files(directory):
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.lower().endswith('.yml') or filename.lower().endswith('.yaml'):
            filepath = os.path.join(directory, filename)
            with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                data = load_safe(f, FullLoader)
                yield data

if __name__ == "__main__":
    directory = "path/to/your/folder"  # Replace with your folder path
    for yaml_data in load_yaml_files(directory):
        print(yaml_data)
```

This script defines a function `load_yaml_files()`, which takes a directory as an argument and iterates through all YAML files inside it. It yields the parsed data of each YAML file, making it easy to process in a loop or using list comprehensions.

In this example, we print every loaded YAML file, but you can replace that with any operation you need. Make sure to adjust the `directory` variable with the correct path to your folder containing the YAML files.

[2025-04-18 00:56:58] Prompt: Write a Python script that loads and parses YAML files in a folder.
Response:
 To load and parse YAML files from a directory in Python, you can use the PyYAML library. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running `pip install pyyaml`. Here is a script that recursively loads and parses all YAML files within a given directory:

```python
import os
import yaml
from yaml.loader import SafeLoader

def load_yaml_files(directory):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.lower().endswith(".yaml"):
                with open(os.path.join(root, file), 'r') as yaml_file:
                    data = yaml.load(yaml_file, SafeLoader)
                    yield root, data

if __name__ == "__main__":
    base_dir = "path/to/your/directory"  # Replace this with the directory containing your YAML files

    for dir_path, yaml_data in load_yaml_files(base_dir):
        print(f"Directory: {dir_path}")
        print(yaml.dump(yaml_data))
```

[2025-04-18 01:11:08] Prompt: cd /mnt/c/Users/PC/Desktop/WORKTABLE
Response:
This command navigates to the "WORKTABLE" folder located on your desktop within the user directory of the C drive. In a Unix-like operating system, such as Linux or MacOS, this command would be:

```bash
cd /Users/PC/Desktop/WORKTABLE
```

[2025-04-18 01:11:16] Prompt: source swarm_env/bin/activate
Response:
 It seems like you are activating a virtual environment, specifically for Docker Swarm, based on the file name `swarm_env`. This command sets up the correct Python and package paths for your project within the virtual environment.

Here's a brief explanation of what happens when you run this command:

1. The shell interprets `source` as a command to read and execute commands from another script file. In this case, it is reading the activation script located in the `bin/` directory of your virtual environment, named `activate`.

2. The activation script modifies the current shell's environment variables (PATH, PYTHONPATH, etc.) to include the paths for your project's Python interpreter and installed packages within this virtual environment. This allows you to work on your project without affecting other projects or global system settings.

3. After running `source swarm_env/bin/activate`, you can proceed with installing and managing dependencies, developing your Docker Swarm project, and running commands within the activated virtual environment. When you're done working on your project, don't forget to deactivate the virtual environment by running `deactivate`. This will reset your shell's environment variables back to their original state.

If you encounter any issues or have questions about using Docker Swarm or working within a virtual environment, feel free to ask!

[2025-04-18 01:14:10] Prompt: source swarm_env/bin/activate
Response:
 Activating the Swarm environment will change your current shell's environment to include the packages and settings found in the `swarm_env` virtual environment. This is often used with Python projects, where different versions of libraries can be managed across multiple environments.

To activate it,
