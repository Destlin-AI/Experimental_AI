Response:
 ```bash

You have navigated to the following directory on your system:

C:\Users\PC\Desktop\WORKTABLE

This command is for Windows operating systems. If you are using a different operating system, such as Linux or macOS, you would use a similar command but with a different file path structure and syntax. For example, in a Unix-like system (such as Linux or macOS), you might use the `cd` command followed by the name of the desired directory, like so:

```bash
cd WORKTABLE
```

If the WORKTABLE directory is located on your desktop, you could also navigate to it using a relative path from the home directory (which varies depending on the operating system):

In Linux or macOS:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/WORKTABLE
```

In Windows (using Cygwin or Git Bash):

```bash
cd /c/Users/PC/Desktop/WORKTABLE
```

Response:
 No, I don't have access to your local files. I am an AI model and do not have the ability to view or interact with any user's local system files. I can help you generate text, answer questions, provide explanations, and perform calculations based on information provided by users.

[2025-04-18 00:39:35] Prompt: source swarm_env/bin/activate
Response:
 This command assumes that you have set up a virtual environment named "swarm_env" with its binary directory at `swarm_env/bin/`. Activating the virtual environment means that any new Python processes started within this shell will use the packages installed in the virtual environment instead of the system-wide ones.

Here's what happens when you run this command:

1. The shell reads and executes commands from the file `swarm_env/bin/activate`. This file is typically a script that performs the following actions:
   - Saves the current shell environment to an external file (for deactivation).
   - Changes the shell's Initial Working Directory (IWD) to your home directory.
   - Sets the `PATH` environment variable by prepending and appending the virtual environment's bin directory to the existing path.
   - Modifies other shell options such as `IFS`, `CDPATH`, and `VIRTUAL_ENV`.

2. After executing this script, your shell will display something like `(swarm_env)`, indicating that the virtual environment is now active. You can now run Python commands or install new packages within this environment.

3. To deactivate the virtual environment and return to the system-wide environment, run the command `deactivate`. This restores your previous shell environment as saved in the external file during activation.

[2025-04-18 00:41:06] Prompt: python rag_runner.py
Response:
 It seems like you are trying to run a Python script named `rag_runner.py`. To execute this script, you would typically open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is located. Here's an example of how you can do it using the Command Prompt in Windows:

1. Open Command Prompt (Press Win+R and type "cmd" then press Enter).
2. Navigate to the folder containing `rag_runner.py` by typing `cd C:\Path\To\Your\Folder` and pressing Enter (Replace `C:\Path\To\Your\Folder` with the actual path of your script).
3. Run the script by typing `python rag_runner.py` and pressing Enter.

If you are using a Unix-based system like Linux or MacOS, the process is similar but you will navigate to the folder using the `cd` command as well, and the syntax for running scripts might be slightly different (you may need to use `./rag_runner.py` instead of just `python rag_runner.py`).

Make sure that Python is installed and properly configured on your system before trying to run the script. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask!

[2025-04-18 00:42:26] Prompt: Write a Python script that loads and parses YAML files in a folder.
Response:
To achieve this, you can use the PyYAML library which allows for easy loading and parsing of YAML files. Here's an example script that recursively scans through a given directory and its subdirectories, loads and parses each YAML file found.

```python
import os
import yaml
from pprint import pformat

def load_and_parse_yaml(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as stream:
        try:
            return yaml.safe_load(stream)
        except yaml.YAMLError as exc:
            print(f'Error while loading YAML file {filepath}: {exc}')

def scan_directory(directory, extension='.yaml'):
    yaml_files = []

    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith(extension):
                yaml_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))

    return yaml_files

if __name__ == "__main__":
    directory = 'path/to/your/directory'
    yaml_files = scan_directory(directory)

    for file in yaml_files:
        data = load_and_parse_yaml(file)
        if data is not None:
            print(f'\n{file}\
